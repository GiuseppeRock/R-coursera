WORLD 50 BEST RESTAURANTS APP

The first tab shows the restaurants on the map.
The ranking is updated at 2019.
Please be patient, since it takes a while to load.
The slider allows you to decide which and how many restaurants to include in the map, based on their ranking.

The chart in the second tab shows the absence of a clear relationship between the ranking and the price of a full tasting menu, drinks excluded, in Euro.
However, there is a stronger correlation between the price level and the number of Michelin stars awarded.
Restaurants not reviewed by Michelin have been excluded from this chart.

However, for both of them the plotly chart does not load when accessed online, but it works if you run the file(s) in your local RStudio.
